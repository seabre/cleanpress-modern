CleanPress Modern
=================
CleanPress is an elegant, clean & white minimal and responsive theme for [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and originally a fork of the OctoPress Slash Theme.
This is a modernized version of the [CleanPress fork](https://github.com/paulicarmody/cleanpress). It includes fixes to address some best practice, accessibility, and SEO issues.

Font
---------------------
The font is currently using Proxima Nova from Typekit, if you don't set this up the fall back is Helvetica Neue.

If you spot any errors then let me know, alternatively take it on and make it better!
